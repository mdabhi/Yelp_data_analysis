I called to make an oil change appointment and was quoted 30-40 minute wait time. Upon arriving at the dealership less than 5 minutes later my wait time was now 1.5 - 2 hours. Not cool. It'll be a long wait before I give them another opportunity. The upside is the service advisor was super friendly. Sucks the dealership has to pull this type of stunt. I had great expectations for Right Toyota. #dirty"

Talk and catch up while you wait for the food.  3) let us all enjoy this amazing, delicious dosa. When you're party is done with your meal (try the filter coffee) leave and let the next person come sit, so they too can  appreciate the food.    4) if you want a more relaxed experience don't come here on Fridays or the weekend."
